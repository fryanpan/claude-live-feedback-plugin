# Project: claude-live-feedback-plugin

## The Goal

Make giving feedback to LLM agents as fast as pointing and saying "this." So fast that Bryan and the agent can iterate on a piece of work in real-time, the way two co-located engineers would.

See [docs/product/vision.md](docs/product/vision.md) for full context — read it before starting any non-trivial work.

## What This Project Is Building

A toolkit for synchronous, multi-user review of three surfaces during agent-driven development:

1. **Markdown + diagram review** — render a markdown file with mermaid diagrams in a browser via Cloudflare tunnel; comments anchored to text ranges; live collaborative edits with redlining UX.
2. **UX mockup review** — lightweight widget injectable into any mockup; element-anchored comments; live-reload preserves comment threads.
3. **Live dev server review** — same widget on a running dev server; agent edits source code, live-reload pushes changes back; comment threads survive.

Plus an "all open comment threads" panel so orphaned comments don't get lost when anchors break.

## Stack

- **Server:** TypeScript + Bun (matches notion-channel-mcp / github-claude-channel pattern)
- **Tunnel:** Cloudflare Tunnel for stable public URLs
- **Widget (injectable into any dev site):** Vanilla JS / web components only — no React/Vue/Svelte deps. Must not conflict with the host site's framework.
- **Realtime collaboration:** TBD — Yjs, Liveblocks, Automerge, or build minimal. See `docs/research/` for evaluation.
- **Agent integration:** MCP server tools + HTTP webhooks. Agents don't need UI; they need clean APIs to observe and act.

## Origin

The feedback widget that ships Linear tickets in `~/dev/health-tool` and `~/dev/family-bike-map` is the starting point. This repo is the next major iteration — the production-feedback flow stays as-is in those repos; this is for the development-time live-loop flow.

## Key Hard Things

(See vision.md for full context.)

- Anchor stability under edits (DOM and text)
- Comment thread tracking when anchors break
- Realtime collaborative editing framework choice
- Lightweight injection without breaking host sites
- Agent-friendly API surface
- Best-in-breed redlining UX

## Conventions

- Lead with goals, not implementation. Top-level docs answer "what becomes possible" before "how it works."
- Public repo with branch protection on main — all changes via PR.
- TypeScript strict mode.
- Widget bundle size is a hard constraint — measure and report it on every PR that touches widget code.
