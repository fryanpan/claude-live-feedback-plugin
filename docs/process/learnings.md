# Learnings

Technical discoveries that should persist across sessions for this project.

## Stateful services + hydration

- Yjs state hydration ≠ binding hydration. Loading `.ydoc` files restores
  doc state but does not re-wire the `observeDeep` listener that schedules
  disk write-back. PR #28 fixed `hydrateFromDisk` to call `attachFile` for
  any markdown doc whose `sourceUrl` resolves on disk. Lesson: any time we
  add a state-hydration path, audit every listener that the live attach
  flow wires up — silent half-attached states are extremely hard to
  diagnose because reads keep working.

## find_and_replace gotchas

- Empties a containing block but doesn't remove it. If a replacement
  drains the only content of a blockquote / list item / paragraph, the
  block stays as an empty shell. Workarounds: use the block-deletion API
  (`delete_block_at_anchor` / `delete_blocks_in_range` / `delete_section`,
  added in PR #6) when you mean to remove a block, or do a clean
  serialization pass at the swap point. Tracked: backlog tasks for an
  inline auto-cleanup behavior.
- Can't split list items. `replace='item-a\n\nitem-b'` produces a paragraph
  break inside one list item, not a sibling item. Backlog: a dedicated
  `insert_list_item_after_text` or `insert_blocks_after_thread` extension.
- Can't add new inline marks. Replacement strings with `**bold**` /
  `*italic*` / `[link](url)` syntax land as literal characters, not marks.
  Backlog: a dedicated `apply_mark` tool.

## Server lifecycle on the Mac Mini

- The live-feedback server has no auto-restart story today. If it crashes
  while Bryan is mobile, his bound docs stop accepting new edits via the
  /review URL (browser shows reconnect loop with `data:` flicker). Restart
  recovers state from `.ydoc` files cleanly. Backlog: install as a launchd
  service alongside the existing `notion-bridge` / `sentry-bridge`
  cloudflared services.
- `bun --watch` does NOT reliably reload on changes to deeply-imported
  files. After landing a server-side fix, restart manually
  (`pkill -f bin.ts && bun run dev`) to verify it's loaded.

## File-binding semantics

- `create_review_doc` is idempotent and re-runnable. Calling it again on
  an existing docId with the same `path` re-runs `attachFile`, which
  re-wires the `observeDeep` listener without re-seeding from disk
  (the seed path is gated on empty fragment). Useful as a recovery tool
  for half-attached docs.
- `attachFile` only re-seeds from disk when the in-memory fragment is
  empty. Once seeded, the in-memory state wins; disk content only
  re-enters via `fs.watch` change events or explicit
  `reparse_from_disk(docId)`.

## Markdown editor footguns

- CSS Grid `1fr` = `minmax(auto, 1fr)`, where `auto` is content-driven.
  Any cell with `1fr` can grow past viewport if its content has long
  unbreakable strings. Use `minmax(0, 1fr)` to force shrink-to-fit.
  Cost a full mobile-overflow PR cycle (PR #22 vs PR #23) to root-cause.
- URLs sent to Bryan must NOT be wrapped in markdown bold/italic/links.
  Some of his clients autolink URLs but don't render markdown, so
  `**https://x.com**` becomes a clickable link that includes the trailing
  `**` and 404s. Always send a bare URL on its own line.
