# Product Decisions

Big decisions that future sessions should respect or revisit deliberately.

## 2026-04-17 — Public repo, branch protection on main
- All changes via PR, even single-file fixes.
- Bryan authorized public visibility because the tool is broadly useful (similar to notion-channel-mcp, github-claude-channel).

## 2026-04-17 — Lightweight widget injection
- The widget that ships into mockups and dev servers must be vanilla JS / web components only.
- Reason: it has to inject into anyone's site without conflicting with their framework choice.
- Bundle size is a hard constraint — measure and report on every PR that touches widget code.

## 2026-04-17 — Server stack: TypeScript + Bun
- Same pattern as notion-channel-mcp and github-claude-channel.
- Cloudflare Tunnel for stable public URLs.

## 2026-04-17 — Realtime collaboration framework: TBD
- Open question. Candidates: Yjs, Liveblocks, Automerge, build minimal.
- Decide before building anchoring infrastructure — the framework choice constrains the data model.
